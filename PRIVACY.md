# Privacy Policy

## Last Updated: December 31, 2025
  
Your privacy is our priority. This Privacy Policy explains how Pokè Budgy handles your information.

## 1. No Data Collection

We believe that your financial data is personal and should stay that way.
**No Personal Information:** We do not collect, store, or ask for your name, email address, phone number, or any other identifying information.
  
**No Financial Tracking:** We do not have access to your bank accounts, credit card details, or transaction history.

## 2. Local Storage Only

All data you enter into the App (budgets, expenses, income) is stored locally on your device.

**No Cloud Syncing:** Your data is never uploaded to a server, database, or cloud service managed by us.
  
**Your Control:** Since your data stays on your device, you are responsible for its security and any manual backups you choose to make. If you delete the App, all data stored within it will be permanently removed.

## 3. No Account Creation

You do not need to create an account or sign in to use the App. There are no usernames or passwords stored on our end.

## 4. Third-Party Access

Because we do not collect your data, we cannot—and will not—sell, trade, or rent your information to third parties. We do not use third-party tracking or analytics tools that send your data to outside servers.

## 5. Permissions

The App may request certain permissions (such as storage access) solely to function correctly (e.g., to save your budget file on your phone). These permissions are used strictly for local operations.

## 6. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. However, our core philosophy—that your data stays on your device—will not change. Any updates will be reflected by the "Last Updated" date at the top of this page.

## 7. Contact Us
